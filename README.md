## openAi embeddings + vector database

Basic example of how to use OpenAI's embeddings API to generate text embeddings and save them to a Postgres vector database. 

The repository includes code that demonstrates how to search the database for similar text data based on cosine similarity scores between the input query and the stored embeddings.

The repository also includes documentation on how to set up and configure the Postgres database and PostgreSQL Vector extension.

This repository can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require text data search and analysis using OpenAI's embeddings API and Postgres vector database.
